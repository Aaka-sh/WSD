            <p>DelEazzy aims to deliver groceries in 15-30 minutes through a network of seller-owned dark stores that emerged from the learnings of online Stores, a hyperlocal delivery marketplace for groceries and other essentials that shut last year.</p>
            <p>
                With the rise of internet orders, particularly in the food and grocery industries, in recent years DelEazzy has started its latest initiative, DelEazzy, with the goal of delivering groceries and other necessities.
                DelEazzy is a chain of online convenience stores. Instant meals, snacks, fruits and vegetables, ice creams, and other things are available through these virtual convenience stores.
                DelEazzy provides these things through its partner “dark stores,” which are exclusively available online and its hubs.
